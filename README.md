# Twitch API - PHP Integration
 A PHP implementation to interact with the Twitch API.

# Register your application with Twitch

1. Login [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps/create) to create the application registration:

    a. Give it a name
    b. Specify the URL to return to
    c. Select the category: Website Integration
    d. Click the Create button.

2. Click the Manage button to view the registration's details.

3. Copy the Client ID.  (Youâ€™ll use to get your access token and to set the Client-Id header in all API requests. Client IDs are considered public and can be embedded in a web pageâ€™s source.)

4. Click the New Secret button then click OK on the pop up window.  Copy the Client Secret.  (This is passed to the token exchange endpoints to obtain a token. You must keep this confidential.)

    NOTE: Do not share client IDs among applications; each application must have its own client ID. Sharing client IDs among applications may result in the suspension of your applicationâ€™s access to the Twitch API.

# Basic usage

The methods return data.  To identify what it returned, you can print it to the screen with print_r().

1. Require the class and create an instance of the Twitch API integration.

    ```
    require_once 'Twitch.class.php' ;

    $twitch = new Twitch( <Client ID>, <Client Secret> );
    ```

2. If your application needs an application token, this is how you request it:

    ```
    $twitch->Get_AppToken();
    ```

    An application token gives you access to their public (non-sensitive) information and doesn't require the user's approval.

3. If your application needs a user approved token, this is how you request it:

    First, get the user to approve your request for permissions.  It will return an authorization code if they do.

    ```
    // Get the User Authorization Code (without providing the optional state variable)
    $twitch->Request_UserAuthorization( "https://site.com/Twitch.php", <List Of Permissions>, null );

    // Get the User Authorization Code (with the optional state variable)
    $twitch->Request_UserAuthorization( "https://site.com/Twitch.php", <List Of Permissions>, <Some State Value> );
    ```

    Get the User Approved Token by submitting the Authorization Code you just received in the GET response.

    ```
    // Get the User Authorized Token using that code.
    $twitch->Get_UserToken( <Authorization Code>, "https://site.com/Twitch.php" );
    ```

4. If you need to validate the existing user approved token, this is how you do it:

    ```
    $twitch->Validate_AccessToken( <User Access Token> );
    ```

5. Submit API Requests

    To identify the required parameters to pass in the requests, please take a look at the [Twitch API Reference](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/).

    ### GET requests - To retrieve data from the API.

    ```
    // Get the analytics of a game played by a user
    $twitch->Get_TwitchData( <User/App Access Token>, "analytics/games?game_id=493057&started_at=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&ended_at=2024-10-01T00:00:00Z" );
    
    // Get a user's details
    $twitch->Get_TwitchData( <User/App Access Token>, "users?login=auronplay&login=zackrawrr" )
    ```

    ### DELETE requests - To delete a Twitch resource.

    ```
    $twitch->Delete_TwitchData( $access_token, "channel_points/custom_rewards?broadcaster_id=12345678-0dar-3fgt-de47-6431c586a7bc" )
    ```
    
    ### PATCH requests - To apply partial updates to a resource.

    ```
    // Disable a custom reward
    $data = array(
      "broadcaster_id" => "12345678",
      "title"          => "test",
      "cost"           => "500000",
      "id"             => "05582bc1-0dar-3fgt-de47-6431c586a7bc",
      "is_enabled"     => true
    );
    $twitch->Patch_TwitchData( $access_token, "channel_points/custom_rewards", $data );
    ```

    ### POST requests - To create a new resource.

    ```
    // Start a 30s commercial
    $data = array(
              "broadcaster_id" => "12345678",
              "length"         => "30"
            );
    $twitch->Post_TwitchData( <User/App Access Token>, "channels/comercial", $data );

    // Create a custom reward
    $data = array(
      "broadcaster_id" => "12345678",
      "title" => "Awesome Reward",
      "cost"  => "500000"
    );
    $twitch->Post_TwitchData( <User/App Access Token>, "channel_points/custom_rewards", $data );
    ```

    ### PUT requests - To update an existing resource.

    ```
    // Change the user's color in chat
    $data = array();
    $twitch->Put_TwitchData( <User/App Access Token>, "chat/color?user_id=12345678&color=blue", $data );
    ```
